# ShipSmart 

## Overview

In the dynamic realm of e-commerce, the ShipSmart project is a cutting-edge solution designed to revolutionize supply chain management for businesses. The primary focus is on optimizing delivery routes, ensuring punctual and cost-effective deliveries. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data structures, ShipSmart empowers e-commerce enterprises to streamline their supply chain operations.

## Features

### 1. Graph Data Structure

ShipSmart utilizes a graph data structure to model the intricate network of delivery locations and their interconnections. Each location is represented as a node, and edges signify the paths between them.

### 2. Shortest Path Algorithms

Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to determine the shortest path between warehouse and customer locations. This ensures that deliveries are optimized for minimal travel distance, contributing to both time and cost efficiency.

### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

ShipSmart tackles the Traveling Salesman Problem by implementing algorithms such as the nearest neighbor algorithm and the branch-and-bound method. These approaches optimize routes for scenarios involving multiple deliveries, ensuring an efficient sequence and minimizing overall travel distance.

### 4. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

To address the maximum flow problem, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is implemented. This algorithm determines the maximum number of products and parcels that can be efficiently delivered from one location to another, optimizing the overall flow of goods.

## Getting Started
